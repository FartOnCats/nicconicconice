A program in python made to brute force google forums.

The inital purpose was to brute force a google forum that required a 4 digit code to submit. The program works by
starting at zero and trying every combo up to 9999. it does this by typing the code then checking the color of the forum box. If the box is red its wrong, if its white it right
